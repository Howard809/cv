<p class="intro"> Welcome to my resume and my first HTML project in at least 4 years. Yes, I learned HTML in high school when I was grade 9, HMS is one of the few schools to offer IT as a course, though frankly I learned more skills in photoshop than I did in coding. However since then, I remember making projects, but I don't remember how I did them. In fact, the background you see on this page is the background of my <em>very first</em> personal webpage that I made back in grade 9. HTML is quite fun, and now that I'm getting the hang of it once again, this marks just the beginning of my projects!</p>
