<p>Although my earliest memories are of living in Taiwan, I did mainly grow up here in Canada and almost all of my education has been here in Richmond. From an early age I was exposed computers and other electronics and for as long as I can remember, I've always loved them and the Internet. I don't mean to brag, but I've used a VCR before.</p>

<p>My musical talents have plateaued but I still try to play from time to time, with often dismay.</p>
